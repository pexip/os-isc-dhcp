isc-dhcp-relay (4.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  ISC has decided to stop maintaining the client and relay parts of isc-dhcp,
  and they will be removed after the 4.4.3 release, keeping only the server
  component. Please, consider using an alternative for isc-dhcp-relay
  (dhcrelay).

  More information can be found in the ISC official announcement:
